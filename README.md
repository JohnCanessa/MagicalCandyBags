You are given a number of bags each with some pieces of candy.
You can eat from one bag each minute all the candy pieces.
After the minute goes by MAGICALLY some pieces appear in the bag.
The idea is to eat as many pieces of candy as you can in the alloted time.

If interested in my approach I invite you to visit the following post in my blog:
